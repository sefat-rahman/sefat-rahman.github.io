## About

I am a Ph.D. student at the Kahlert School of Computing and the SCI Institute at the University of Utah, advised by Dr. Paul Rosen. My research focuses on Topological Data Analysis and Scientific Visualization.

Before joining Utah in January 2023, I earned an M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of South Florida in December 2022. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Khulna University of Engineering & Technology in February 2018.

Previously, I was a Lecturer at Eastern University, Dhaka. In 2016, I interned at IPVision Inc., Canada, working with QA and Big Data teams on the social networking platform *ringID*.

Outside academics, I enjoy sports and the outdoors—especially soccer, hiking, and exploring nature. I'm currently working on learning skiing.
